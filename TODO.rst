TODO List
=========

This file should have a list of things which need doing on the project.

Here are the initial TODO's for adapting the package.

1.  Read + update the SPEC.rst file. Pick a package name.
2.  Update setup.py, conf.py and re/change module names (also in `lib`/`tests`)
3.  Remove scripts from bin/make your own interface script
4.  Start writing code + testing.
