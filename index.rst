This is the 'welcome page' of the package's documentation.

It should have:

*  A 100 word summary of what the module does
*  An example of how to use it.
*  An index (as follows).

Optional items to add later (once the package is out of its prototype phase)

*  Version history (probably good to do this sooner rather than later)
*  User documentation
