Module Specification
====================

This file should contain information on what the module does, and how
it is put together.

It doesn't need to be long, but should

*  comprehensively list the features of the package
*  give pointers to where and how these features can be found within the package

The contents of this file can evolve with the project, it is normally
helpful to start out as a very short summary of what the module is supposed
to do before starting to code away (otherwise, why bother writing a module?).

I recommend reading:

For small projects, that second link probably feels like a lot of work. Keep in
mind though that small projects tend to get bigger very quickly.
